## How to Run

- Currently, the only requirement needed to run this program is needing pygame and PIL libraries installed!
- To run, execute the cuboids.py file in your IDE! It will then open up, generating a random character.

## Creating a Character

- Customize a character by changing around their skin tone, clothing, hairstyle and more!
- When exporting a character, sprites are created, with their forward, backward, left, and right movements, as well as their animations.
- These sprites will appear in the exported folder.

## Add More Customization

- This program was intended to make characters for a larger life simulation game (no longer in progress).
- However, you can still use the program to generate a pixelated avatar!
- To make new customizable items for characters, an image of the clothing is needed for forward, backward, left, and right side profiles.
